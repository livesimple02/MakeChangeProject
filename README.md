the change required using the least amount of dollar bills and coins.

### Technologies Used

-Java
-Conditionals
-Looping
-Switch
-Type Casting
-Method Calling with returns
-Float Formatting

### How to Run

The program will prompt for a dollar amount to be paid followed by the dollar
amount tendered. Values entered here must be positive numbers with up to two
decimal places.

The program will return the change that would need to be provided using the
least number of bills and coins.

Following a transaction, the program will prompt the user for whether they would
like to perform another transaction.
Acceptable user responses here include:
  'Y' or 'y' to perform another transaction.
  'N' or 'n' to exit the program.
  Any other entry will notify the user and wait for another entry.

### Lessons Learned

When fixing errors to account for all possible outcomes, if the program seems
like it is getting too complicated for a simple task, it probably is. Step away
and think of other methods to come to a solution.
